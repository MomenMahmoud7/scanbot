## Structure

**src will be the core application source code.**

### /assets

- all the static assets.

### /components

- all the shared components.

- all the components should be registered and exported from /index.js for a single access point.

- all the components should bear named export to avoid any conflicts.

- components that consist of complex logic, can be further de-structured to small components inside.

### /screens

- all the various features/screens/pages.
- each screen consists of an index.js file which exports the screen components composition as default module.

### /hooks

- all the custom hooks.

### /utils

- all the utility/helper methods.
